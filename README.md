# JioPay Customer Service Chatbot 

An intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that provides instant, accurate answers about JioPay services. This project involves complete web scraping of the JioPay website, data processing, and building a production-ready conversational AI assistant.

##  Live Demo

The app is deployed on Hugging Face Space.

##  Project Overview
This is an end-to-end AI chatbot project that demonstrates the complete pipeline from data collection to deployment. The chatbot acts as a virtual customer service representative for JioPay, capable of answering questions about payments, wallet features, UPI transactions, recharges, bill payments, and more.
Why This Matters
Traditional customer support relies on human agents or rigid rule-based systems. This RAG-based chatbot:

- Provides instant 24/7 support
- Answers with source citations for transparency
- Uses semantic search to understand user intent
- Scales to handle unlimited concurrent users
- Always stays up-to-date with official documentation

## Project Workflow
### Phase 1: Web Scraping with Selenium
Automated the entire JioPay website scraping process using Selenium WebDriver to collect comprehensive documentation.

* Set up automated browser navigation for JioPay's official website
* Handled dynamic JavaScript-rendered content with proper wait conditions
* Scraped 200+ pages including help center, FAQs, feature docs, and support articles
* Implemented error handling and retry logic for robust data collection
* Output: Raw HTML content and structured data from entire website

### Phase 2: Data Processing & Structuring
* Transformed raw scraped data into clean, structured formats ready for AI processing.
* Parsed HTML and extracted meaningful text content
* Cleaned data by removing duplicates, ads, and navigation elements
* Organized content by categories (payments, wallet, UPI, recharges, etc.)
* Generated 4 structured files:

The csv and json files were generated after scraping the website
- jiopay_links_content.csv - Website page content
- jiopay_faqs.csv - Question-answer pairs
- jiopay_help_center_faqs.json - Hierarchical help articles
- jiopay_links_content.json - Structured website data


* Output: Clean, queryable datasets with 500+ documents

### Phase 3: RAG Pipeline Development
Built an intelligent retrieval system combining vector search and LLM generation.
Architecture Flow:
* User Query → Embedding → FAISS Search → Top-3 Documents → LLM Context → Generated Answer + Sources
Key Components:

* LlamaIndex: Loaded and indexed all documents with metadata
* HuggingFace Embeddings: Converted text to 384-dim vectors using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
* FAISS Vector DB: Stored embeddings for ultra-fast similarity search (<50ms)
* LangChain: Created custom retriever to bridge LlamaIndex and LLM
* Groq LLaMA 3.1: Generated accurate, context-grounded responses

### Key Features: Semantic understanding, source attribution, zero hallucinations, real-time retrieval
### Phase 4: Deployment (Gradio Interface)
- Created a user-friendly web interface and deployed for public access.
- Built chat interface using Gradio for natural conversations
- Implemented real-time response streaming with source citations
- Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for permanent, free hosting
- Mobile-responsive design accessible from any device
- Output: Live chatbot with public URL

##  Features

- **Semantic Search**: Uses FAISS vector database for fast and accurate information retrieval
- **Source Citations**: Shows exact source snippets from official JioPay documentation
- **Real-time Responses**: Powered by Groq's LLaMA 3.1 model for quick answers
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Gradio web interface
- **Multi-format Support**: Processes both CSV and JSON data files

##  Tech Stack

- **LlamaIndex**: Document indexing and semantic search
- **LangChain**: RAG chain implementation
- **FAISS**: Vector database for similarity search
- **Groq API**: LLM inference (LLaMA 3.1-8B)
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: Sentence transformers for text embeddings
